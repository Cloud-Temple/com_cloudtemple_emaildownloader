## What is it ?

The emaildownloader zimlet allows zimbra users to download their own webmail elements, whether it is a contact, an email or even an appointment for other usages, or as backups.

Each of the downloadable elements will be saved as a generically formatted file (.eml for emails, .vcf for contacts, .ics for appointments) which allows for easier usage.

## How to make use of the zimlet

* Drag'n drop the selected element(s) onto the "Downloader" label, located into the Zimlet panel.
